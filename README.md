## Project Title: 
Recyclable and Household Waste Classification.

## Introduction:
This project is an educational endeavor completed using Kaggle datasets. The goal was to perform models to classify waste by pictures.

## Datasets:
Utilized the Recyclable and Household Waste Classification Dataset from Kaggle ([link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alistairking/recyclable-and-household-waste-classification)).

## Context
This dataset contains a comprehensive collection of 15,000 images (each 256x256 pixels) depicting various recyclable materials, general waste, and household items across 30 distinct categories. 
With 500 images per category and 250 images per subcategory, this dataset provides a rich and diverse resource for research and development in the fields of waste classification and recycling. 
By offering a large number of high-quality images, this dataset aims to support the creation of robust and accurate waste sorting and categorization systems.

## Project Structure:
The project includes models training, and evaluation.

## Results:
